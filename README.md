Hexathlon schematic generator

Expecting a games file:
```
1. Game name 1
2. Game name the second
3. Third game
4. Game the fourth
5. 5th Game
6. Last
```

Also expecting a file with the teams.  
The line ends with the placement of previous year.  
That lets the program match the better teams against each other.
```
Team 1|3
Team 2|1
Team 3|2
etc
```
